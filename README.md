# lingxi
Lingxi is an IoT platform primarily designed for private cloud deployment scenarios. It mainly has the following characteristics: one click deployment, rich protocols, massive products, unlimited expansion, and fully open source. It is taken from a Chinese idiom, "Without colorful phoenix wings, the heart has a telepathic connection," which means that the Internet of Things can be as smooth and free as a telepathic connection.
